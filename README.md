This is a multi-year graduate level project with the goal of detecting and locating the northern aurora during any time conditions. 

The aurora are a visual manifestation of how highly
energetic charged solar particles interact with the
Earth’s magnetic field. Beyond its beauty, the aurora
can influence the dynamics of the thermosphere. Its
effects in the thermosphere can be seen by the
changes in:

❖ Temperature

❖ Density and composition

❖ Wind patterns

By studying these effects, we gain insights of the
complexities and variability of the upper atmosphere.
GOLD data offer a unique advantage of taking
measurements within the FUV range, allowing for the
distinction of the auroras without contamination from
ground/city lights due to shorter wavelengths of light
being absorbed more easily in the atmosphere.
